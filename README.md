## Description:
```
This is a node.js application that utilises the express, mysql and sequelize packages to create
the backend of a fictitious e-commerce shopping website. A schema and seed data are provided to 
setup the database in mysql, while sequelize provides the means to create the tables and the 
relationships with ease. Express handles the api routing and interactions with the database 
alongside sequelize. Finally the api requests are demonstrated using Insomnia, this includes
GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests.
